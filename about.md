title: About Me
---

<strong>Hello!</strong> I am a student at NC State University studying
computer science and math. Some of my interests include data science,
computer vision, robotics, and the theory of computation and computability,

In my free time, I work with NC State's Aerial Robotics Club. Currently, I am
working on modernizing our DevOps system by converting our VM-based dev
environments with Docker containers and, along with that, updating all of the
associated documentation. Additionally, I am also responsible with manning the
flight PC during flights and for updating and maintaining the various drivers
and controllers for the plane.

On top of that, I have been doing volunteer contributions to Dr. Jamie
Jennings's Rosie Pattern Language, such as collecting experimental runtimes
and comparing those against predicted and other pattern matching tools. I
have also been create a PKGBUILD for the Arch User Repository.

Personally, I am a FOSS enthusiast. Some of my favorite projects are Neovim,
being my daily text editor (and what I'm writing this in right now); Gobot,
because I like robotics and Golang; pLam, because lambda calculus is
fascinating; and, of course, Rosie Pattern Language. I run Arch Linux on my
main laptop, although I normally put Debian or Ubuntu on my servers, and I
maintain some PKGBUILDs on the Arch User Repository.

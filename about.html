<h2>Who is Eli?</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Hello!</strong> I am a student at NC State University studying
  computer science and math. Some of my interests include data science,
  computer vision, robotics, and the theory of computation and computability,
</p>
<p>
  In my free time, I work with NC State's Aerial Robotics Club. Currently, I am
  working on modernizing our DevOps system by converting our VM-based dev
  environments with Docker containers and, along with that, updating all of the
  associated documentation. Additionally, I am also responsible with manning the
  flight PC during flights and for updating and maintaining the various drivers
  and controllers for the plane.
</p>
<p>
  On top of that, I have been doing volunteer contributions to Dr. Jamie
  Jennings's Rosie Pattern Language, such as collecting experimental runtimes
  and comparing those against predicted and other pattern matching tools. I
  have also been create a PKGBUILD for the Arch User Repository.
</p>
<p>
  Personally, I am a FOSS enthusiast. Some of my favorite projects are Neovim,
  being my daily text editor (and what I'm writing this in right now); Gobot,
  because I like robotics and Golang; pLam, because lambda calculus is
  fascinating; and, of course, Rosie Pattern Language. I run Arch Linux on my
  main laptop, although I normally put Debian or Ubuntu on my servers, and I
  maintain some PKGBUILDs on the Arch User Repository.

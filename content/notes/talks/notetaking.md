This lecture does ***not*** discuss class notes, paper notes, journaling.
Instead, we're talking about notes for creating things and improving
creativity.

The big picture is thinking about notetaking; the habits which inform the use
of our notes; and the principles which inform our structure.

Here are names and misc things mentioned.
* Tiago Forte's "Second Brain": System for taking notes.
* Zettelkasten: Inspiration for Tiago Forte's "Second Brain". This was a
  physical system of notecards and links with notecards.
  * Andy Matuschak: English source for Zettelkasten.
  * SÃ¶nke Ahrens: Another writer.
* Notational Velocity: Note taking app.
* Atom Notes: Notational velocity for Atom.
* Vim Notes: <https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim>

# Thinking About Notetaking

Think of brain as data structure where ...
* Input: Reading, lectures.
* Preprocessing: Note system.
* Queries: Recall.
* Application: Make something.

Think of yourself as three selfs: past self, current self, and future self.

You should think of future self in two ways: as a stranger and as yourself. As
a stranger, you want to build the tools and take the notes to help a future you
which has forgotten things. As yourself, you want to help yourself.

*Aside: I enjoy writing notes like I'm talking to someone else because of
this.*

You can waste time even if you're doing something productive. For example, if
you read something incredibly deep or learn a lot but don't take any notes.
When you later forget that, your past self wasted your current self's time.

# Habits

* Atomic Notes: Every note should be small, focused, and standalone.
* Start from Abundance: Takes lots of notes. Don't try to do a "heavy lift"
  where you do all the work at once. If you take lots of small notes, you can
  slowly build up to something large.
* CODE: (From Tiago Forte)
  * C: Capture / Collect good ideas.
  * O: Organize information. We'll emphasize *links* of information.
  * D: Distill ideas. Think of as refactoring.
  * E: Express. Make stuff.
* Play: Get comfortable exploring your notes and "having conversations with
  your past self".

# Principles

* Text files
* Full text search
* Easy to make and follow links
* Fast note creation

A good bonus is having executable code.

Around January-March/April, try to visit campus!

Many universities normally have the final acceptance date as April 15th.

Do the leg work for finding teaching assistantships and research
assistantships. It's not enough to just check the boxes.

Statement of purpose should vary based on the university. Talk about specific
research that they are doing and perhaps even a specific professor. Talk about
what you bring to the table. Speak about time as software team lead at aerial
robotics club.

If you email a professor before you have an application or before you have even
been accepted, you might be wasting your time. It's good to know the professors
you want and do your research for your application because it looks good in
your essays but a lot of professors don't really want to respond when someone
hasn't even been accepted yet.

Give recommenders a "package". That is, tell them some information about what
insight you want them to provide, what your goal is to do in grad school, and
possibly even your resume or CV.

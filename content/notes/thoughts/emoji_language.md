# Clauses

**Structure:** Subject-Verb-Object/Destination

Each must be one emoji and all must be present for clause to be complete.
Within a clause, the same emoji ALWAYS refers to the same object/event; use
identifiers to have multiple similar objects/events.

# Types of Clauses

* **Clauses:** Look at diagram. To go up a level, don't follow up clause with
  conjunction.
* **Main:** 1st clause must be this, simply a statement.
* **Descriptive:** Clause which gives more information about previous emoji.
* **Causal:** Clause explains a reason the earlier one did happen.
* **Concessional:** Clause explains a reason the earlier one shouldn't have
  happened.
* **Optional:** Group of any clause where only 1 of the clauses can be true.

# Tenses

To give more information about the state or timing of a verb, you can put one
of the special tense emojis immediately before it. These do not count to the
"clause emoji count". All time information is relative to the time of writing.

* General "": Something which typically occurs, is occurring, or always occurs.
  The most common tense and should be used if more specificity is not needed.
* Past "🕘": Something which did occur and has now finished.
* Present "🕛": Something which recently began occurring and is still occurring
  and will continue occurring.
* Future "🕒": Something which has not yet occurred but likely will later.

## Examples of Tenses

* 👈🙏🍽️: I want a meal / to eat.
* 👈🕘🙏🍽️: I used to want a meal / to eat.
* 👈🕛🙏🍽️: I currently want a meal / to eat.
* 👈🕒🙏🍽️: I will want a meal / to eat.

# Clauses

Introduce new clauses.

* ➕: Additional. Following clause is the same as the earlier one. "And" or
  "But"
* ➖: Optional. Following clause and earlier clause are of same level but only
  1 can be true. "Or" or "Either... Or"
* ✖️: Causal. Following clause is causal, causing earlier. can not follow a
  descriptive clause. "Because" or "Since"
* ➗: Concessional. Following clause is concessional, explaining a reason the
  earlier one shouldn't have happened, can not follow a descriptive clause.
  "Although"
* 🔎: Descriptor. Begins descriptive clause which describes the preceding
  emoji.

# Special Emojis

Do not count towards emoji count.

* 🚫: Negator. Negates emoji immediately following, does count toward emoji
  count.
* 🔗: Integrator. Following emoji was present for or integral to the action
  (accompaniment vs means must be inferred), follows an entire clause.
* ❓: Interrogator. At the beginning of clause, presents the next clause as a
  "true or false" question.
* 0️⃣1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣4️⃣5️⃣6️⃣7️⃣8️⃣9️⃣🔟: Identifiers. Follow emoji to give it an ID so one can use the
  same emoji for multiple different subjects.

# Pronouns

* 👈: 1st person singular.
* 👐: 1st person plural.
* 👉: 2nd person.
* 👇: Demonstrative pronoun (often followed by a descriptive clause),
  essentially can be used like a placeholder for a noun. This is essentially an
  unspecified object/event.

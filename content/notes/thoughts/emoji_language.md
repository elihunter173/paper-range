# Structure

Every clause in the emoji language follows the strict "Subject - Verb -
Object/Destination" structure. Each part must be one emoji and all must be
present for clause to be complete. Within a message, the same emoji refers to
the same object/event; use identifiers to have multiple similar objects/events.

*Example:* I know you = "👈🧠👉".

You can also have exclamations, which are just a single emoji indicating the
exclamation.

*Example:* It's raining = "🌧️".

## Emoji Descriptors

Every emoji can have a description phrase associated with it. These phrases are
placed after the emoji they describe and start with a single, special emoji
indicating what kind descriptor it is.

* ➰ (... ➿): Adjective phrase. This phrase contains a list of adjective-type
  emojis, followed by a ➿ to indicate the end of the adjective phrase. If you
  only have one adjective-type emoji, ➿ does not need to be specified.
  * *Example:* My dog ate a big round chicken = "🐕➰👈🍴🐔➰🆙⚪➿".
* 〰️: Descriptive clause. Begins a new subject-verb-object clause which
  specifically describes the affected emoji. Usually, you will include the
  emoji itself in the clause. "Which", "Where".
  * *Example:* The dog, which I bought, makes me happy = "🐕〰️👈💳🐕😊👈"
* 🚫: Negator. Negates emoji immediately following. This does not have any
  emojis in its descriptor phrase. "Not".
* 0️⃣1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣4️⃣5️⃣6️⃣7️⃣8️⃣9️⃣🔟: Identifiers. Since emojis tend to refer to the same
  object/event, you can use identifiers to differentiate between similar
  objects/events.

## Clause Modifiers

Clauses can have modifiers which affect their meaning. These modifiers are
placed immediately after the clause which they affect.

* ❓: Interrogator. Marks the prior clause as a true-false question. "Right?".

## Verb Modifiers

Verbs in particular can have modifiers. These modifiers are placed after the
verb they affect, just like with clause modifiers and emoji descriptors.

Currently, the only modifiers are tense modifiers. If tense is unspecified,
verbs are in their basic form which is roughly present tense. It means
something which typically occurs, is occurring, or always occurs.

* 🕘: Past. Something which did occur and has now finished.
  * *Example:* I used to want a meal = "👈🙏🕘🍽️"
* 🕛: Present. Something which recently began occurring and is still occurring
  and will continue occurring.
  * *Example:* I currently want a meal = "👈🙏🕛🍽️"
* 🕒: Future. Something which has not yet occurred but will later.
  * *Example:* I will want a meal = "👈🙏🕒🍽️"

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions introduce new subject-verb-object clauses with a specific relation
to the previous one.

* ➕: Additional. The following clause exists in addition to the previous one.
  "And" or "But".
* ➖: Optional. Either the following clause or the preceding clause are true,
  but not both. "Or" or "Either... Or".
* ✖️: Causal. The following clause caused or motivated the earlier clause.
  "Because" or "Since".
* ➗: Concessional. The following clause occurred in spite of the earlier one,
  explaining a reason the earlier one shouldn't have happened, can not follow a
  descriptive clause. "Although".

# Vocabulary
